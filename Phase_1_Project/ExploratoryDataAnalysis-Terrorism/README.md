# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

This repository contains code and data for my Data Science internship project at CodersCave, which is focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The project involves in-depth data exploration, visualization, and insights generation to better understand the underlying patterns and trends in the dataset. EDA plays a crucial role in preparing the data for subsequent analysis and modeling stages.
