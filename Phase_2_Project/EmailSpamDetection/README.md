## Overview

Spam emails can be a significant problem. This project aims to provide a solution for automatically detecting spam emails using machine learning techniques. The project includes data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `EmailSpamDetection.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis.
- `data.csv`: Sample dataset for training and testing the spam email detection model or install in kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/venky73/spam-mails-dataset
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages to run the project.

## Getting Started
