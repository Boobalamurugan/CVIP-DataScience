This repository contains four projects exploring various data analysis and machine learning techniques:

## Project 1: EDA for Terrorism Data

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset related to terrorism events. It aims to understand the patterns and trends in the data, gaining insights into the nature and distribution of terrorist activities.

## Project 2: Breast Cancer Detection

This project implements machine learning algorithms to classify breast cancer tumors as benign or malignant based on various medical features. It focuses on evaluating and comparing the performance of different models.

## Project 3: Email Spam Detection

This project builds a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam. It explores feature engineering and model selection techniques to achieve optimal performance on the email corpus.

## Project 4: Speech Emotion Recognition

This project investigates the use of machine learning for recognizing emotions in human speech. It explores various audio features and machine learning models to accurately identify emotions spoken in audio recordings.
